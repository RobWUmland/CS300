You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. 
It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. 
You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Throughout this course we were acting as the developers on a software project for the fictional ABC University. We were tasked with creating a program to aid
the CS advisors with course information that they can provide to their students. This involved importing data from a .csv file that could be read out informing 
the party of prerequisites for a particular course. Searching and printing out data requires different amounts of processing power depeding on the type of data 
structure used to hold the information. We learned about vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. Each has their strengths and weaknesses in 
implementation. By analyzing the run-time requirements for each structure, we could identify the best method for this particular use case. The biggest issues
during this project were related to best practices for importing the data provided. Many times the program would need extra error handling to deal with incorrect 
input by the user. Not having worked with any of these structures previously, besides vectors, the work has added to my choices of data structurs depending on the
needs and in general the work improved my understanding of creating methods to keep the system more streamlined, modular, and portable.
